    "\n",
    "Coming back from the semester break and now being shown new systems and processes was quite daunting as I haven't used Github much before, and adjusting seems difficult. At first attempting the Pandas review questions seemed stressful as I hadn't done much revision and was unsure how much I remembered, however it all came back to me fairly quickly, apart from using conditional checks and for the most part I was feeling much more confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding stuff went mostly well and so did setting up the Github account, however deciding on the project topic was difficult as all the topics seemed interesting and it was tough to narrow it down. The conditional checks in the Pandas questions didn't go well due to not having done them much in semester one and not having reviewed the code enough in the break. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have learned that I should practice and keep my coding skills up during the break, and that I should take notes on topics that aren't covered in the Pandas cheatsheet that I refer to. I should have been more proactive last semester to prevent this. To make up for this before next session I'll spend more time revising Pandas and getting comfortable with Github.   \n"

    "This week during the data cleaning phase of the project the group cooperated really well as even though there were only three of us we managed to progress and overcome a set of challenges. We initially faced a challenge in figuring out how to group the store's individual days to calculate the cumulative sales which was stressful and frustrating at the time. It took time, but after some teamwork we managed to figure it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that worked well was our group collaboration as it took far less time than we were expecting to break down the problem and code the solution, however, the part that didn't work as well was my hesitancy to try solving it. I think the reason I wasn't confident was due to a lack of knowledge on grouping using Pandas. By not having this required knowledge I was unsure of how to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from this experience that I can and should rely more on my group, as trying to do everything myself is overwhelming. Moreover, I should trust my group members more as even when they had done it correctly I was still sceptical, which is awful for group cohesion and morale. To combat this in the future I need to be more open and willing to approach difficult coding challenges and rely on my group members skills more. Additionally, I should spend more time learning how to clean and manipulate larger datasets with Pandas to help prevent myself getting stuck on these types of problems, and to allow for more time to spend  investigating the data rather than just cleaning it."
