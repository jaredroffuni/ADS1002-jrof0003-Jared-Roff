    "Coming back from the semester break and now being shown new systems and processes was quite daunting as I haven't used Github much before, and adjusting seems difficult. At first attempting the Pandas review questions seemed stressful as I hadn't done much revision and was unsure how much I remembered, however it all came back to me fairly quickly, apart from using conditional checks and for the most part I was feeling much more confident.\n",

    "The coding stuff went mostly well and so did setting up the Github account, however deciding on the project topic was difficult as all the topics seemed interesting and it was tough to narrow it down. The conditional checks in the Pandas questions didn't go well due to not having done them much in semester one and not having reviewed the code enough in the break. \n",

    "I have learned that I should practice and keep my coding skills up during the break, and that I should take notes on topics that aren't covered in the Pandas cheatsheet that I refer to. I should have been more proactive last semester to prevent this. To make up for this before next session I'll spend more time revising Pandas and getting comfortable with Github.   \n"

    "This week during the data cleaning phase of the project the group cooperated really well as even though there were only three of us we managed to progress and overcome a set of challenges. We initially faced a challenge in figuring out how to group the store's individual days to calculate the cumulative sales which was stressful and frustrating at the time. It took time, but after some teamwork we managed to figure it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that worked well was our group collaboration as it took far less time than we were expecting to break down the problem and code the solution, however, the part that didn't work as well was my hesitancy to try solving it. I think the reason I wasn't confident was due to a lack of knowledge on grouping using Pandas. By not having this required knowledge I was unsure of how to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from this experience that I can and should rely more on my group, as trying to do everything myself is overwhelming. Moreover, I should trust my group members more as even when they had done it correctly I was still sceptical, which is awful for group cohesion and morale. To combat this in the future I need to be more open and willing to approach difficult coding challenges and rely on my group members skills more. Additionally, I should spend more time learning how to clean and manipulate larger datasets with Pandas to help prevent myself getting stuck on these types of problems, and to allow for more time to spend  investigating the data rather than just cleaning it."

    "After finishing the data cleaning we moved on to exploratory data analysis, with us each deciding on a topic to explore. The rest of my group took the main points we wanted to explore so I decided to do something different and investigate the outliers in the data to see if there were any unusual yet interesting points of data. Initially, I felt quite confident with this as I had done something similar last semester and found an exciting talking point, but whilst manipulating the dataframe I wasn't able to find anything particular of interest. There was one major outlier where a store had more customers than usual, but there wasn't a particular reason behind it, which was frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the group didn't get through as much as we had hoped, especially because the same group members have missed multiple weeks in a row of classes now, making it difficult to communicate with them. I instead agreed to attempt the time series graphs, which is quite overwhelming as when trying the in-studio exercises I struggled to make any graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that went well from the group work was that we are still ahead of schedule, however, the things that went poorly were the amount of work done by the other group members and also the lack of communication from those who weren't showing up to class. I've learned from this that I need to be more proactive in communicating with those who aren't showing up and to ensure that they stay up to date. So in the future, I need to make sure to communicate with the group outside of class time to make sure we are keeping up with the timeline we initially set to prevent stress later on in the semester."

    "After finishing the data cleaning and exploring the outliers I moved onto the time series graphs, where I made one for the particular store with the outlier I was previously exploring, and after a lot of trouble I got it to work, then I attempted to group each individual dates sales by sum and average to explore how the store did over time and seasons. I managed to group the data fairly easily, but the challenge is the time series currently don't represent the data well due to the fact that some days are closed and so the sales is 0. Before the task I was feeling very confident in being able to group it, and less confident with the time series, because as I expected they were problematic. After a lot of time spent on it, I still wasn't able to figure out how to fix the time series graphs visuals, so I have to leave this until Monday, which is frustrating as I hoped to have them done by then so we could focus as a group on the mock presentation. This means we won't have as much time to prepare the presentation which is stressful, and I'm sure the rest of my group is feeling the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the graphs visuals don't look good is due to some days being closed so I need to find a way to filter those out of the daily sales averages and sums. I currently am unsure of how to do this so I'll need to ask in studio on Monday, and so until then the only work I can do is insert what I've done so far into the slides. The skills I need to develop to handle situations like this better in the future is how to group data better and how to make time series graphs look better. In order to develop these skills I need to ask for help in studio, and then use the help to adjust the data and continue working with it to improve my skills. "
